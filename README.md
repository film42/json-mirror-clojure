# JSON Mirror in Clojure

So this is simple compojure app that responds with any data thrown at it. Fully unlocked cors means anyone can use it.

I actually made a node app for this, but decided I'd like to try clojure and this came to mind, so here it is. On my local machine, speeds are about the same as node+express, with the hand slightly tipping toward clojure+compojure.
